# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
It is usful to use a conditinal when comparing variables and printing the comparison. 
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
I think I would approch it the same way. I used the rubber duck method alot which helped me work out my problems up until the spicy challenge. 
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
After multiple tries and multiple talks with my desk duck I got the most satisfaction from finally running my medium challenge code and it evaulating exactly what I ws hoping for. I had an verbal outburst when I got it to work.
